# RetDec

[RetDec](https://retdec.com/) is a retargetable machine-code decompiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

The decompiler is not limited to any particular target architecture, operating system, or executable file format:
* Supported file formats: ELF, PE, Mach-O, COFF, AR (archive), Intel HEX, and raw machine code.
* Supported architectures (32b only): Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.

Features:
* Static analysis of executable files with detailed information.
* Compiler and packer detection.
* Loading and instruction decoding.
* Signature-based removal of statically linked library code.
* Extraction and utilization of debugging information (DWARF, PDB).
* Reconstruction of instruction idioms.
* Detection and reconstruction of C++ class hierarchies (RTTI, vtables).
* Demangling of symbols from C++ binaries (GCC, MSVC, Borland).
* Reconstruction of functions, types, and high-level constructs.
* Integrated disassembler.
* Output in two high-level languages: C and a Python-like language.
* Generation of call graphs, control-flow graphs, and various statistics.

## Installation and Use

Currently, we support only Windows (7 or later), Linux, and unofficially macOS.

**Warning: Decompilations of larger binaries (1 MB or more) may require a lot of RAM. When running decompilations, we advise you to limit the maximal virtual memory for processes before decompiling to prevent potential swapping and unresponsiveness. On Linux, you can run e.g. `ulimit -Sv 9863168` in your shell to limit the maximal virtual memory to 8 GB.**

### Windows

1. Either download and unpack a pre-built package from the following list, or build and install the decompiler by yourself (the process is described below):

    * [32b Windows](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/releases/download/v3.0/retdec-v3.0-windows-32b.zip) (v3.0)
    * [64b Windows](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/releases/download/v3.0/retdec-v3.0-windows-64b.zip) (v3.0)

2. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

3. Install [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) and other needed applications by following RetDec's [Windows environment setup guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment).

3. Now, you are all set to run the decompiler. To decompile a binary file named `test.exe`, run

    ```sh
    bash $RETDEC_INSTALL_DIR/bin/retdec-decompiler.sh test.exe
    ```

   For more information, run `retdec-decompiler.sh` with `--help`.

### Linux

1. There are currently no pre-built packages for Linux. You will have to build and install the decompiler by yourself. The process is described below.

2. After you have built the decompiler, you will need to install the following packages via your distribution's package manager:

    * [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (version >= 4)
    * [UPX](https://upx.github.io/)
    * [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/)
    * [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

3. Now, you are all set to run the decompiler. To decompile a binary file named `test.exe`, run

    ```sh
    $RETDEC_INSTALL_DIR/bin/retdec-decompiler.sh test.exe
    ```

   For more information, run `retdec-decompiler.sh` with `--help`.

### Process

**Warning: Currently, RetDec has to be installed into a clean, dedicated directory. Do NOT install it into `/usr`, `/usr/local`, etc. because our build system is not yet ready for system-wide installations. So, when running `cmake`, always set `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to a directory that will be used just by RetDec. For more details, see [#12](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/12).**

* Recursively clone the repository (it contains submodules):
  * `git clone --recursive https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec`
* Linux:
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make && make install`
* Windows:
  * Open MSBuild command prompt, or any terminal that is configured to run the `msbuild` command.
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> -G<generator>`
  * `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release retdec.sln`
  * `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj`
  * Alternatively, you can open `retdec.sln` generated by `cmake` in Visual Studio IDE.
* macOS:
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * ```sh
    # Apple ships old Flex & Bison, so Homebrew versions should be used.
    export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/include"
    export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/lib;/usr/local/opt/bison/lib"
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"
    ```
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make && make install`

You have to pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to set the installation path to `<path>`.
* (Windows only) `-G<generator>` is `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015"` for 32-bit build using Visual Studio 2015, or `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` for 64-bit build using Visual Studio 2015. Later versions of Visual Studio may be used.

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DRETDEC_DOC=ON` to build with API documentation (requires Doxygen and Graphviz, disabled by default).
* `-DRETDEC_TESTS=ON` to build with tests, including all the tests in dependency submodules (disabled by default).
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build with debugging information, which is useful during development. By default, the project is built in the `Release` mode. This has no effect on Windows, but the same thing can be achieved by running `msbuild` with the `/p:Configuration=Debug` parameter.
* `-DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH=<path>` to use Perl at `<path>` (probably useful only on Windows).

## Build in Docker

Docker support is maintained by community. If something does not work for you or if you have suggestions for improvements, open an issue or PR.

### Build Image

Building in Docker does not require installation of required libraries locally. This is a good option for trying out RetDec without setting up the whole build toolchain.

To build the RetDec docker image, run
```
docker build -t retdec .
```

This builds the container from the master branch of this repository.

To build the container using the local copy of the repository, fully clone the repository:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, build the container using the development Dockerfile, `Dockerfile.dev`:
```
docker build -t retdec:dev . -f Dockerfile.dev
```

### Run Container

To decompile a binary, create a container to upload the binary to:
```
docker create --name retdec_init retdec
```

Upload the binary (note the destination directory should be a directory with read/write permissions, such as `/home/retdec/`):
```
docker cp <file> retdec_init:/destination/path/of/binary
```

Commit the copied files into the container image:
```
docker commit retdec_init retdec:initialized
```

Run the decompiler:
```
docker run --name retdec retdec:initialized retdec-decompiler.sh /destination/path/of/binary
```

Copy output back to host:
```
docker cp retdec:/destination/path/of/binary.c /path/to/save/file
```

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the following libraries:
* `bin2llvmir` -- library of LLVM passes for translating binaries into LLVM IR modules.
